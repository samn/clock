#Clock

This proof of concept shows you approximatley how many seconds have elapsed in a minute without needing to display them.  It fades between two colors so you can see a glance whether the minute has just started or is ending.

##TODO:
* Specify colors for different times,
  e.g. a specific color for 15, 30 & 45 seconds
  so you can see how many seconds have elapsed with more precision
